There is nothing more confusing for someone stepping into the world of programming than encountering an error that points to a line which turns out to be blank!

This "phantom" error can feel impossible to fix, but is usually caused by a simple oversight, like a missing bracket.

This and many other pitfalls are what make CS an interesting journey, rather than a lecture-driven odyssey.
